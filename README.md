A score calculator for NEBULOUS: Fleet Command's control game mode.
Currently limited to typical 5 points and no time limit. Caps needed to win assumes all caps are controlled by a team (no neutrals remain).

## USAGE

- Click the control point icons to change the team that controls them.

- Make any necessary adjustments to the score.
- The score will be updated as you make changes.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Does not account for neutral control points.
- Limited to 5 control points, no time limit.
- Time before next cap needed only works for case of 3 to 4 points needed
