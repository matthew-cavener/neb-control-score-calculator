# neb-score-calc

A score calculator for NEBULOUS: Fleet Command's control game mode.

## USAGE

- Click the control point icons to change the team that controls them.
- Use the timer sync button to sync the clock to the match.
- Make any necessary adjustments to the score.
- The score will be updated as you make changes.
- Recommended to set cap ownership before setting team point totals

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Tie is sometimes predicted when one team is ahead by 2 points and teams have equal caps
- When running in a browser window, the tab may be suspended by the browser, causing the timer to fall behind. Run native windows or linux version to resolve.
